BARDOM is a Django-based web application designed as a foundational platform to address the fragmentation in legal services. The aim is to connect users with legal service providers and offer a space where young lawyers can showcase their services and build their careers.

Process Flow Explanation

The user lands on the homepage where a list of legal services or consultation products is displayed.

Clicking on any service redirects to a detailed view, which fetches data using Django ORM (Read operation on SQLite).

Users can register or log in to access personalized features.

Logged-in users can add services to their cart and proceed towards checkout.

Payment integration using Stripe is in progress — the logical flow is already prepared.

The admin panel enables management of legal services — adding, updating, or deleting services as required.
